## What Is an IoT API?

> An IoT API (Application Programming Interface) is a standardized communication
> bridge between IoT devices and the external applications or systems that interact
> with them.

Instead of every smart home app needing to understand each manufacturer's
proprietary protocol, an API provides a unified interface. A single application can
control thermostats, lights, door locks, and security cameras from different vendors
because the API abstracts the underlying hardware differences away.

---

## Tasks an IoT API Can Perform

| Task | Description |
|---|---|
| **Device Control** | Send commands to devices — turn lights on/off, lock doors, adjust thermostat settings |
| **Data Retrieval** | Read sensor values or device status at any point in time |
| **Event Handling** | Subscribe to device-generated events (motion detected, door opened) and trigger responses such as notifications or automated actions |
| **Configuration Management** | Update device settings, schedules, thresholds, and parameters remotely |

## Main API Types

APIs are classified into four types based on who can access them and under what
conditions.

### Open (Public) APIs

> Open APIs are publicly available with no access restrictions, approval processes,
> or fees.

Key characteristics:

- **Accessibility** — documentation is publicly available; no barriers to entry.
- **Transparency** — clearly documented so any developer understands what the API
  offers and how to use it.
- **Flexibility** — supports multiple programming languages and various use cases.

Companies expose Open APIs to encourage third-party developers to extend their
platforms.

**IoT example:** Samsung SmartThings API — allows any developer to connect,
automate, and manage smart home devices including lights, thermostats, and sensors.

---

### Partner APIs

> Partner APIs are not publicly available. Access requires a license, permission,
> or a formal partnership agreement with the provider.

Key characteristics:

- Access controlled via API keys or other authentication mechanisms.
- Documentation exists but is shared only with approved partners.
- Providers typically offer dedicated support, tutorials, and sample code to
  onboarded partners.

**IoT example:** Amazon Web Services (AWS) IoT API — allows developers to connect
IoT devices to the cloud, manage device data securely, and build scalable IoT
applications, but is governed by AWS terms and service agreements.

Social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram also offer Partner
APIs for approved third-party integrations.

---

### Internal (Private) APIs

> Internal APIs are designed exclusively for use within a single organization and
> are never exposed to external developers or end users.

Key characteristics:

- Documentation is accessible only to internal teams and developers.
- Access is restricted to authorized systems within the organization's internal
  network.
- Unlike public APIs built for external consumption, internal APIs connect internal
  services to each other.

---

### Composite APIs

> A Composite API combines multiple API types into a single call, executing them
> synchronously to improve speed and performance efficiency.

Rather than making several sequential API calls, a composite API bundles them.
This reduces round-trip overhead and is especially useful when a client needs data
from multiple sources in one operation.

---

## Comparison Summary

| Type | Availability | Access Control | Primary Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|
| Open / Public | Anyone | None or minimal | Third-party app development |
| Partner | Approved partners only | API keys, agreements | Controlled integrations |
| Internal / Private | Organization only | Network + auth restrictions | Internal microservices |
| Composite | Depends on components | Depends on components | Multi-source, single-call operations |

## API Communication Styles in IoT

The three main communication API styles used in IoT systems are:

- **REST** — follows the Request-Response model
- **WebSocket** — follows the Exclusive Pair model
- **SOAP** — Simple Object Access Protocol

The following parts cover each in detail.
