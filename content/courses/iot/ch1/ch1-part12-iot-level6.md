## What Is IoT Level-6?

> A Level-6 IoT system has **multiple independent end nodes** that each perform
> sensing and/or actuation and send data directly to the cloud. A **centralized
> controller** in the cloud is aware of the status of all end nodes and sends
> control commands back to them. The analytics component analyzes data and stores
> results in the cloud database. Results are visualized through the cloud
> application.

Level-6 is the most complete IoT deployment model. There is no coordinator node
aggregating data locally — each node is independent and communicates directly with
the cloud. Intelligence is fully centralized in the cloud controller.

**Key distinction from Level-5:** Level-5 uses a local coordinator to funnel data
upward. Level-6 nodes each communicate independently, and the cloud controller
provides top-down command and control across all of them simultaneously.

● Multiple Monitoring Nodes ──► Centralized Controller ──► Cloud Storage & Analysis
```

Each node connects independently to the cloud. The centralized controller has a
global view — it knows the state of every node and can dispatch targeted commands
to individual nodes or groups.

## Application: Smart Building / Industrial Monitoring

Multiple nodes monitor different parameters across different zones of a building or
facility — temperature in one room, gas levels in another, energy consumption in a
third.

**How it works:**

- Each node sends its data directly to the cloud independently.
- The analytics component processes data from all nodes.
- The centralized controller detects anomalies or threshold violations across the
  whole system.
- The controller dispatches targeted commands back to specific nodes — activate
  cooling in Zone 1, trigger a gas alarm in Zone 2.
- Results are visualized on a cloud-based dashboard.

**Why Level-6:** No local coordinator is needed or wanted. Each node is
independent. The cloud has full visibility and full control. This is the model for
large-scale industrial deployments where central coordination must span many
devices across many locations.

## MATLAB Simulation

```matlab
time = 0:1:60;

% Node 1 - Temperature sensor (independent cloud upload)
Temp = 20 + randn(1, length(time));
writetable(table(time', Temp', 'VariableNames', {'Time', 'Temp'}), ...
    'Node1Data.xlsx');

% Node 2 - Gas sensor (independent cloud upload)
Gas = 30 + randn(1, length(time));
writetable(table(time', Gas', 'VariableNames', {'Time', 'Gas'}), ...
    'Node2Data.xlsx');

% Centralized Controller (cloud-side logic — reads all nodes independently)
TempData = readtable('Node1Data.xlsx');
GasData  = readtable('Node2Data.xlsx');

if mean(TempData.Temp) > 25
    disp('Central Controller: Send cooling command to Node 1');
end
if mean(GasData.Gas) > 35
    disp('Central Controller: Trigger gas alarm at Node 2');
end
```

Each node writes to its own file independently — no coordination between Node 1
and Node 2. The centralized controller reads all sources and issues targeted
commands.

## Full Level Comparison

| Level | Nodes | Analysis | Storage | App | Example |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Single | Local | Local | Local | Home Automation |
| 2 | Single | Local | Cloud | Cloud | Smart Irrigation |
| 3 | Single + gateway | Cloud | Cloud | Cloud | Package Tracking |
| 4 | Multiple | Local + observer | Cloud | Cloud | Noise Monitoring |
| 5 | Multiple end + coordinator | Cloud | Cloud | Cloud | Forest Fire Detection |
| 6 | Multiple independent | Cloud (centralized controller) | Cloud | Cloud | Smart Building |

> The progression: single node → multiple nodes → coordinator → independent nodes
> with centralized cloud control. Each level trades local simplicity for cloud
> scalability and intelligence.
