## The Limitation of Traditional RPL

Traditional RPL selects parents using a fixed Objective Function with static weights:

```
Cost = W1*(Delay) + W2*(ETX) + W3*(Energy)
```

The weights are set at design time and never change. The network is static by
assumption. But real IoT networks are not static — traffic patterns shift, nodes
drain their batteries, links degrade, and topology changes. Fixed weights cannot
adapt to any of this.

**AI makes RPL adaptive instead of static.**

---

## What AI Adds to RPL

Rather than fixed weights, AI models can dynamically learn:

- Which parent is currently best given real-time conditions.
- Which route is more stable over time.
- Which node is likely to fail soon — and reroute preemptively.
- How to reduce energy consumption across the whole network, not just locally.

---

## Intelligent Parent Selection

An AI-enhanced node selects its parent based on predicted performance, not just
current measurements. It considers:

- Current traffic load and congestion on candidate paths.
- Packet loss rate trends.
- Remaining battery level of candidate parents.
- End-to-end delay predictions.

During congestion, AI may deliberately select a slightly longer path with lower
delay — a trade-off a fixed Objective Function cannot make.

---

## Dynamic Objective Function

Instead of fixed weights, AI adjusts them based on environment and application:

**Healthcare IoT** — latency is critical:

```
W1(Delay)=0.60, W2(ETX)=0.20, W3(Energy)=0.10, W4(LinkQuality)=0.10
```

**Environmental monitoring** — energy saving is critical:

```
W1(Delay)=0.15, W2(ETX)=0.20, W3(Energy)=0.50, W4(LinkQuality)=0.15
```

The weights change dynamically with traffic load, node energy levels, link
conditions, application requirements, and even time of day.

## AI Techniques Used in Research

---

**1. Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Parent Selection**

---

The node (RL agent) tries different parents and observes outcomes: delay, packet
loss, energy, stability. Good performance yields a reward; bad performance yields
a penalty. Over many transmissions, the agent learns which parent consistently gives
the best long-term results and selects it more often.

> RL does not need predefined rules. It learns by interacting with the environment.

---

**2. Deep Q-Network (DQN) for Routing Optimization**

---

DQN is an advanced form of RL that uses a neural network to predict Q-values
(expected reward) for each candidate next hop. It handles larger state spaces and
learns faster than basic RL — better suited for complex, dynamic IoT topologies.

---

**3. Predictive ML for Link Quality & Congestion**

---

ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM) are trained on historical network data.
Given current measurements (RSSI, ETX, traffic load, packet loss, mobility), they
predict future link quality and congestion — before degradation happens. RPL can
then switch routes *proactively*, avoiding bad links before they cause retransmissions.

---

**4. Fuzzy Logic for Dynamic Objective Function**

---

Fuzzy logic handles uncertainty in routing metrics. Instead of crisp numeric
thresholds, it uses linguistic rules:

- *IF Delay is Low AND Energy is High AND ETX is Low → Parent Quality is Excellent*
- *IF Delay is High OR ETX is High OR Link Quality is Low → Parent Quality is Poor*

The output is a "Parent Quality Score" that RPL uses for parent selection. Fuzzy
logic makes the Objective Function context-aware without requiring a full ML model.

---

**5. Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for Topology Awareness**

---

GNNs learn from the full network graph as input — capturing multi-hop relationships
that single-node metrics cannot see. They identify more efficient and reliable routes
by understanding how the entire topology behaves, not just local link conditions.

---

**6. Anomaly & Attack Detection Using AI**

---

Autoencoders, LSTM, and SVM models monitor routing behavior, DIO/DAO patterns,
packet forwarding, and link changes to detect attacks like sinkhole, blackhole, and
selective forwarding. This protects RPL routes and enables trust-aware routing.

---

## Benefits Achieved in Research

- Higher Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR).
- Lower end-to-end delay.
- Better energy efficiency and longer network lifetime.
- Improved scalability and reliability.
- Better adaptation to dynamic, real-world IoT environments.
