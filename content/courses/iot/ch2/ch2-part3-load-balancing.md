## What Is Load Balancing?

**Load balancing** is the practice of distributing processing and communication
tasks fairly among IoT, edge, fog, or cloud nodes so that no single node becomes
a bottleneck.

---

## The Problem Without It

Imagine 100 sensors and two controller services. Without load balancing, sensors
naturally route to whichever controller is closest. One controller ends up with the
majority of the traffic:

- High CPU usage and overload.
- Higher electric power consumption on that node.
- Increased delay for all traffic through it.
- The other controller sits underutilized — wasted capacity.

This is not a theoretical edge case. It is the default behavior of unmanaged IoT
networks.

## The Result With It

When load is distributed evenly across nodes:

- Delay decreases — no single bottleneck to queue behind.
- Congestion reduces — traffic spreads across available paths.
- QoS improves — packets arrive more reliably and on time.
- Energy consumption improves — no single node burns out its battery carrying the
  entire network's load.

## Solutions

Several approaches can achieve load balancing in IoT:

**Dynamic scheduling** — continuously monitors system resources and redistributes
tasks before any node becomes overloaded.

**Software Defined Networking (SDN)** — a centralized controller with a global
view of traffic, bandwidth, congestion, and node load can make optimal routing
decisions in real time.

**AI / Machine Learning** — modern IoT systems increasingly apply reinforcement
learning, fuzzy logic, and genetic algorithms to predict future traffic patterns,
detect overloaded nodes early, and optimize energy usage proactively.

**Clustering** — cluster heads act as indirect load balancers. A cluster head
collects data from its cluster, aggregates it locally, and forwards only the
processed result — reducing total traffic volume and distributing the forwarding
burden.
